
Biryani is a mixed rice dish originating from the Indian subcontinent. It is made with Indian spices, rice, and usually some type of meat — such as chicken, mutton, beef, or seafood. Vegetarian versions also exist and are popular in many regions.

The word “biryani” is derived from the Persian words "birian" (fried before cooking) and "birinj" (rice). It was brought to India by Persian travelers and merchants and later developed into many local styles across the country.

Biryani is not a single dish but a family of related dishes with regional variations. Each has its own unique flavors, preparation techniques, and spice blends.

Hyderabadi Biryani is one of the most iconic styles, known for its strong spices, saffron aroma, and dum (slow cooking) method. It often uses basmati rice layered with marinated meat, fried onions, and yogurt, then sealed and slow-cooked

Lucknowi or Awadhi Biryani is more subtle, with a focus on aroma and delicate flavors. It uses the pukki (pre-cooked) method, where rice and meat are cooked separately and then layered.

Kolkata Biryani, influenced by Awadhi styles, often includes potatoes and boiled eggs. It is lighter on spices compared to southern biryanis and has a distinctive use of rose water and kewra essence.

In South India, Thalassery Biryani from Kerala uses a small-grain rice called kaima and has influences from Arab traders. Tamil Nadu’s Dindigul Biryani is known for its use of jeera samba rice and a tangy flavor from curd and lemon.

Biryani is usually served with side dishes such as raita (yogurt with herbs), salan (spicy curry), or boiled eggs. The aroma, spices, and the contrast between fluffy rice and juicy meat make biryani a beloved dish across India and around the world.

Today, biryani is a global dish enjoyed in restaurants and homes alike. It represents a perfect blend of culture, history, and culinary artistry.
